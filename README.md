# Sampler 

### drum machine / sample sequencer / sound editor

## Web Audio API

## Working:

- decodes array of audio file urls and loads each sample onto the next pad after clicking the start screen
- allows user to upload each pads sound through a button on pad
- Sequencer
- Effect section within Sequencer allows for each track to have unique effects applied

## Currently:

- have pads be triggered by keyboard presses as well
- create instruction screen to help users

## todo:

- reformat data structure used by sequencer for effect data to increase efficiency
- adapting screen and functionality to mobile devices
- Tap Tempo?
- Clean UI
- Audio file wavelength editor (SliceX)?
